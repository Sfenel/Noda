## Visual note-taking on a (nearly) infinite canvas.
![Noda Logo](Noda-logo.png)\
Noda is a visual note-taking application that allows you to create and organize your thoughts and ideas on a (nearly) infinite canvas. This guide will briefly go over the features and limitations of Noda.
#### Nodes
Nodes are Noda's version of notes. They can be used to store text and image information anywhere on the canvas. To create a node, right click the canvas and hit the icon. Nodes can be moved using the handle at the top, and resized using the handle at the bottom right. To add images, use to paste from clipboard, to upload image from file, and to insert an image from URL. Adding an image to a node will replace that node completely, removing text you may have there. It is recommended to add images to blank nodes only. Nodes can be deleted using the button, and duplicated using the button.
#### Canvas Navigation
Left click and drag the canvas to pan. Use ctrl + and ctrl - to zoom in and out (browser built-in feature). Press the button in the right click menu to recenter the canvas. The canvas has a size of about 225 million square pixels, not quite infinite but good enough.
#### Multiple Canvases
There is a dock at the top center of the screen you can use to create and access multiple different canvases. Use the dropdown to select between existing canvases, and the buttons to the right of the dropdown to rename, create, or delete entire canvases.
#### Settings
Pressing the icon in the bottom right will open the settings menu. From here you can personalize Noda to your liking. You can toggle dark/light mode, enable or disable grid snap, and adjust color schemes of node borders. Also, you can backup your canvases to file using the export and import buttons. Your canvases will autosave every 5s, but browser local storage can be a bit of a pain sometimes. You also have the option here to reset the current canvas.
#### Offline Usage
If you would like to install Noda locally for offline usage, the code can be downloaded from this Github repository.
